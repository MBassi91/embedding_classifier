# Project Overview and Instructions
This project is designed to classify text using embeddings and a fast classifier.

## Installation
To install the required dependencies, run:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage
1. Prepare your dataset:
   - Ensure your dataset is in a CSV format with columns for text and corresponding labels.
   - Place the dataset file in the `data` directory.

2. Fetch embeddings:
   - Set up an OpenAI API key by setting the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable.
   - Run the `embeddings.py` script to fetch embeddings for your text data.

3. Train and evaluate classifiers:
   - Open the `classifier.ipynb` notebook.
   - Update the dataset file path in the notebook to point to your dataset.
   - Run the notebook cells to train and evaluate different classifiers (logistic regression, random forest, SVM).
   - The notebook will select the best classifier based on the F1-score.

4. Save and use the trained classifier:
   - The best classifier will be saved as `best_classifier.pkl` in the project directory.
   - To use the trained classifier in your own code, load the saved model using the `TextClassifier.load_model()` method.

5. Assess the need for more data:
   - The `classifier.ipynb` notebook includes a section to plot the learning curve for the best classifier.
   - Analyze the learning curve plot to determine if the model would benefit from more training data.
   - If the model is overfitting (high training score, low cross-validation score), consider collecting more data to improve generalization.

## Suggestions
Thanks to the magic of embeddings, a binary classificator on a medium complexity NLP task requires around 300 curated data points to reach very high precision levels (multilingual). My suggestion is, especially if you have a small data source, to try checking at various levels if the model is strongly overfitting, as that works as a good indicator of the need for more data.

Consider the following:
- Collect a diverse and representative dataset covering various text patterns and labels.
- Start with a small dataset and gradually increase its size while monitoring the model's performance.
- Use cross-validation to assess the model's generalization ability and detect overfitting.
- If overfitting occurs, prioritize collecting more data over tuning the model architecture or hyperparameters.
- Regularly evaluate the model's performance on a held-out test set to ensure it generalizes well to unseen data.

By iteratively assessing the model's performance and gathering more data as needed, you can build a robust and accurate text classifier using embeddings and a fast classifier.
